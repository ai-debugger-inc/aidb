# AI Debugger 0.1.0 - Initial Release

**GitHub Release**: [0.1.0](https://github.com/ai-debugger-inc/aidb/releases/tag/0.1.0)

**PyPI**: [ai-debugger-inc](https://pypi.org/project/ai-debugger-inc/)

## Introducing AI Debugger

AI Debugger (AIDB) is a lightweight, language-agnostic Python API that enables AI systems to programmatically control and introspect live debugging sessions through the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP).

Instead of reading code and guessing at fixes, AI agents can now set breakpoints, pause execution, inspect the actual values in variables, and step through code line by line - just like a human developer would.

### Why It Matters

We've all seen AI agents confidently propose fixes that don't work. The problem is they're reasoning about static code without seeing what actually happens at runtime. With AI Debugger, an agent can:

- Pause execution at the exact line where something goes wrong
- Look at the actual values in variables, not what they "should" be
- Trace the call stack to understand how execution got there
- Make grounded fixes based on real runtime state

### What You Can Do With It

- **Debug flaky tests** - Let the agent inspect state when tests fail intermittently
- **Attach to running containers** - Debug JVMs in Docker without stopping the service
- **Investigate production-like environments** - Remote attach to staging servers
- **Understand unfamiliar codebases** - Step through execution to learn behavior

## Installation

```bash
pip install ai-debugger-inc
```

### MCP Client Configuration

Add to your MCP client configuration (Claude Code, Cline, Cursor, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-debugger": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "aidb_mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Debug Adapters

Adapters are downloaded automatically on first use:

- **Python**: debugpy (Microsoft)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: vscode-js-debug (Microsoft)
- **Java**: java-debug (Microsoft)

Storage location: `~/.aidb/adapters/`

## MCP Tools Reference

AI Debugger exposes 12 tools through the Model Context Protocol:

### Initialization

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `init` | **Required first step.** Initializes debugging context, discovers capabilities, loads launch.json configurations |

### Session Management

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `session_start` | Create and start a debug session (launch, attach, or remote attach modes) |
| `session` | Manage session lifecycle: status, list, stop, restart, switch |

### Execution Control

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `execute` | Run program from beginning or continue from current position |
| `step` | Step through code: into functions, over lines, or out of current function |
| `run_until` | Run to a specific location using temporary breakpoints |

### Inspection & Modification

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `inspect` | Examine program state: locals, globals, stack, threads, expressions |
| `variable` | Get, set, or patch variables at runtime |
| `breakpoint` | Manage breakpoints: set, remove, list, clear; supports conditions and logpoints |

### Configuration

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `config` | Show configuration, environment, launch.json discovery, adapter status |
| `context` | Get debugging context with intelligent next-step suggestions |
| `adapter` | Download, list, and manage debug adapters |

---

## Key Features

### Advanced Breakpoints

- **7 hit condition modes**: `>`, `>=`, `=`, `<`, `<=`, `%` (modulo), exact count
- **Conditional breakpoints**: Break only when expression evaluates true
- **Logpoints**: Log values to output without pausing execution
- **Column-level breakpoints**: Precise placement for minified code
- **Real-time verification**: Immediate feedback on breakpoint validity

### VS Code Integration

Reuse your existing `launch.json` configurations:

```python
session_start(
    language="python",
    launch_config_name="Python: Django",
    workspace_root="/path/to/project"
)
```

No duplicate configuration needed - AI Debugger discovers and uses your existing debug settings.

### Remote Debugging

Attach to running processes locally or across networks:

```python
# Attach to JVM in Docker container
session_start(
    language="java",
    mode="remote_attach",
    host="localhost",
    port=5005,
    source_paths=["/local/path/to/source"]
)
```

### Multi-Session Support

Debug multiple processes simultaneously - useful for microservices, client-server applications, or comparing behavior across environments.

## Architecture Highlights

### Human-Cadence Operation

AI Debugger is designed for AI agent workflows, not typical API speed:

- Breakpoints must be set before starting execution
- Inspection happens when the program is paused
- Stepping is one operation per line - just like a human debugger

### Language-Agnostic Design

The same Python API works across all supported languages through pluggable adapters built on the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP).

### Minimal Dependencies

Core installation requires only 3 dependencies:
- `mcp` - Model Context Protocol
- `aiofiles` - Async file operations
- `psutil` - Process utilities

No heavy IDE dependencies.

|----------|--------|
| macOS (Intel) | Fully supported |
| macOS (ARM/M1+) | Fully supported |
| Linux (x86_64) | Fully supported |
| Windows | WSL recommended; native support in progress |
