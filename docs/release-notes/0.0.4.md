**GitHub Release**:
[0.0.4](https://github.com/ai-debugger-inc/aidb/releases/tag/0.0.4)

## Overview

CI/CD simplification release - streamlined workflows and removed redundant automation.

## Changes

- Simplified test workflow triggers (tests now run via release-pr or manual dispatch only)
- Removed redundant `build-test-deps.yaml` workflow (test-parallel already builds adapters/Docker)
- Added pip install retry logic in smoke tests to handle TestPyPI propagation delays

## Fixed

- Fixed TestPyPI smoke test failures caused by index propagation delays
- Fixed ReadTheDocs build by upgrading to Python 3.12 and installing package for autoapi

## Internal Changes

- Removed `maintenance-dependabot-auto-merge.yaml` (Dependabot PRs now merged manually)
- Removed `sync-dependabot-updates` job from release-publish workflow
- Updated CI/CD documentation and skills to reflect workflow changes
