**GitHub Release**:

## Overview

Environment variable handling improvements and shell portability fixes.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed user-provided environment variables (e.g., `PYTHONPATH`, `JAVA_HOME`, `NODE_PATH`) not being applied to debug subprocesses when passed via the `env` parameter in `session_start`
- Fixed `requires_docker` test marker to properly skip tests when Docker daemon is not running
- Fixed shell portability issues in install scripts (`python` → `python3`)

## Enhancements

- Added `destructiveHint` annotation to MCP tools that can modify state (breakpoint, adapter)

## Internal Changes

- Centralized `_target_env` initialization and merging in base `DebugAdapter` class
- Added `_merge_target_env()` method to base adapter environment preparation pipeline
- Removed duplicate `_target_env` initialization from Python, JavaScript, and Java adapters
- Added comprehensive unit tests for environment variable merging (12 tests)
